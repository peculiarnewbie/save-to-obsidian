# Save to Obsidian

An unnoficial chrome extension to precisely get data from webpages. created with the intent to use with [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) properties. Heavily inspired by [Save to Notion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-notion/ldmmifpegigmeammaeckplhnjbbpccmm)

### This extension is unofficial and is **NOT** affiliated in any way with the Obsidian.md team

## Installation

You can download the extension through the Chrome Webstore here:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-obsidian/oadbfjklomnnpchhbgchohhejkiibifm

or you can:

1. Download the zip file from releases
2. Unzip the extension
3. Open the Chrome Extension page and enable developer mode
4. Choose load unpacked and select the unzipped folder that contains the manifest file

Or you can build from source. But note that on the generated manifest, you'll need to delete the css portion of the content scripts or it might affect your pages' styles

## Usage

1. Open the webpage you'd like to clip
2. Click on the extension button
3. Select Add Form
4. Provide form name and download directory (it'll be relative to the 'downloads' directory)
5. Add properties and select page elements that you would like to save
6. Save the form
7. Download the MD file
8. Open up a different page with equal page structure and open the previously saved form
9. The properties will be automatically filled with the equivalent element's values

## Example

This is an example of a form I made for youtube videos:

![Youtube Page](./public/example/Youtube%20Page.png)

it will result in this md file:

![Youtube Result](./public/example/Youtube%20Result.png)

You can then do all kinds of things with the file. For example I use Obsidian and Dataview to have interesting videos, music, and movies that i consumed that day queried in my daily note

![Daily Note](./public/example/Daily%20Note.png)

## Roadmap

-   add every obsidian property type (number, tags, checkbox, and tags)
-   better date selection experience
-   Integrate with Obsidian using Obsidian local rest api plugin
-   lots more options for the properties, such as default regex, inline option, etc
-   better detailed selection experience
-   header data selection system

### Extra

don't worry about the env files, it's just an easy way to tell the extension wether it's in dev mode or not
